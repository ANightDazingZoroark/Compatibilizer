# Compatibilizer
A compatibilizer for Prehistoric Rift and Borgy's Mobs. This addon will be updated after either one of the two addons gets updated if necessary. The following interactions can happen when this addon is installed.

* Triceratops' rivalry buff can be triggered by Bakunawas
* Saurophaganaxes will eat Headcrabs (& their variants), Headcrab Zombies (& their variants), Manananggals, and Sigbins, and eating them will affect if they will use their light blast attack
* Headcrabs (& their variants) and Headcrab Zombies (& their variants) are affected by the Saurophaganax Light Blast attack
* Manananggals, Plaguebirds, Houndeyes, Bull Houndeyes, Hoteyes, Sarimanoks, Headcrabs (& their variants), and Headcrab Zombies (& their variants) will run from Parasaurolophuses using their scare horn
* Nearly every mob from Borgy's Mobs (except Bullsquids, Plaguebirds, Icthyosaurs, and Bakunawas) will attack Parasaurolophuses using their aggravating horn
* Saurophaganaxes will eat Headcrab Meat (cooked and raw), and wild Saurophaganaxes will also go after dropped raw and cooked headcrab meat
